# How do I math and program at the same time?

This repository contains vanilla JavaScript used to make geometric
solids. Give [Xah Lee](http://xahlee.info/) money if you find this
content/code useful.

See it online on [Github Pages](captainalan.github.io/xah-geometry).

This site makes use of the [Bootstrap starter
template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)
(4.3) in addition to plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

How do I get playing around with math graphics,
geometry, and programming?

> for math, wikipedia has tons of info, half of it is so very

But... math is hard...

And for programming?
